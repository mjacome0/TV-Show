In the root directory, install needed dependencies by running:
```
npm install

Once installed, you can start the server by running:
```
npm start

A production build might be required to run on certain browsers.
In the root directory, run:
```
npm run-script build
```
A new folder called build should have been created.
To launch the server, I used the following command:
```
serve -s build
```
Screenshots that I took have been included in the Screenshot folder.
